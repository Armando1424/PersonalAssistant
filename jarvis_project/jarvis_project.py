#importing all the necessary libraries
#you ll have to manually install beautifulsoup and gtts brfore importing
#i also had to install ffmpeg on my system
#one of the necessary libraries is "pip3 install SpeechRecognition"
#maybe do you need install the following programs:
#sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio
#sudo apt-get install libjack-jackd2-dev portaudio19-dev
#pip3 install pyaudio
